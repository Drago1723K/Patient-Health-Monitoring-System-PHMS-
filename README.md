Patient Health Monitoring System (PHMS) using ESP32

ABSTRACT :
    This project presents a comprehensive patient health monitoring system utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller interfaced with various sensors and a webserver for real-time data visualization and alert management. The system monitors vital health parameters, including heart rate and SpO2 using the MAX30100 sensor, body temperature using the DS18B20 sensor, and room temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor. Additionally, it controls the room temperature through a relay system, which activates a heating mechanism when the body temperature falls below 37Â°C.
